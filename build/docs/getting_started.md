### Prerequisites 

Ligra can be compiled with multiple backend compilers. We currently support

* `g++ >= 4.8.0` with support for `Cilk Plus`
* Intel `icpc` compiler
* `OpenMP`

### Organization

[Download](https://github.com/jshun/ligra/archive/master.zip) the code if you 
have not already. The main directories are the `apps` directory, where we will
program and compile applications, and the `ligra` directory, where the framework 
code lives. 

``` bash
$ cd ligra
$ ls -1
apps        # code for Ligra applications
inputs      # example graph inputs
LICENSE
ligra       # code for the Ligra framework
README.md
utils       # utilities for parsing different graph formats
```

### Compilation

Compilation is done from within the `apps/` directory. Depending on the compiler
you wish to use, you will need to set a different environment variable. 

* `g++` using `Cilk Plus`: define the environment variable `CILK`. 
* `icpc`: define the environment variable `MKLROOT` and make sure `CILK` is not defined. 
* `OpenMP`: define the environment variable `OPENMP` and make sure 
  `CILK` and `MKLROOT` are not defined. 

Using `Cilk Plus` seems to give the best parallel performance in our experience. To compile 
with `g++` with no parallel support, make sure `CILK`, `MKLROOT` and `OPENMP` are not 
defined.

### OpenMP on OSX

On OSX, the g++ binary installed through commandline-tools should error out if you try
to use OpenMP. If you encounter this error, you will need to install `g++-4.8` or 
`g++-4.9`. You can easily do this by using `homebrew` as follows: 

``` bash
$ brew tap homebrew/versions
$ brew install gcc49
```

Finally, open up the Makefile and replace `g++` with `g++-4.9` (or `g++-4.8`). Your
code should cleanly compile. 

###Example

``` bash
$ cd apps/
$ export CILK=1
$ make
ln -s ../ligra/encoder.C .
ln -s ../ligra/ligra.h .
...
g++ -fcilkplus -lcilkrts -O3 -DCILK   -o encoder encoder.C
g++ -fcilkplus -lcilkrts -O3 -DCILK   -o BFS BFS.C
...
```
